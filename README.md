# Go API Server for api

A standard for blockchain interaction

## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

- API version: 1.2.3
- Build date: 2020-03-20T20:39:49.560Z[GMT]

### Building

Run

```
make all
```

This will compile bls-zexe rust library that is required for celo-blockchain

On subsequent builds, you can just run `go build ./...`

### Running the server
To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t api .
```

Once image is built use
```
docker run --rm -it api 
```



## How to generate RPC code

Copy `swagger.json` to a folder, and then run inside that folder: 
```
alias openapi-generator='docker run --rm  -v ${PWD}:/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli'
openapi-generator generate -g go-server -i /local/swagger.json -o /local/generated \
  --additional-properties="packageName=api,sourceFolder=api" \
  --git-user-id=celo-org --git-repo-id=rosetta
```

Then generated code will be at `generated` folder. Copy whatever you need to the repo
